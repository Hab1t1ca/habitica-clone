This is a mobile web app designed to help you keep track of daily tasks and to-do lists by "gamifying" your life. 

The user first logs in using their google account and will then be directed to create an avatar using a photo from their device or one of the pre-made images.

Once the avatar is made the user can create daily tasks or make a to-do list.
The daily tasks need to be completed by midnight everyday or else the avatar will take damage.

Completing a task or to-do item will grant the user experience and gold. Both make more items available in the shop.

The user can also embark on a quest that will reward them with more gold and experience. You make the quests easier and more forgiving, the user can use one of the abilities that was given to them when they made their avatar.
